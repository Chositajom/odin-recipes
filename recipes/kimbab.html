        <h2>Kimbap, one of Korea's most popular snacks, can have all sorts of fillings</h2>

        <h3>Ingrdients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large (12-ounce; 340g) cucumber</li>
            <li>sea salt</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>medium (8-ounce; 240g) carrot</li>
            <li>cups cooked short-grain (sushi) rice, hot </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>rim cucumber ends and cut it in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scrape out the seeds from each half. Cut each half lengthwise into three long strips to make 6 strips total. Place cucumber strips on a plate, sprinkle all over with salt, and toss well to coat. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, beat eggs with a pinch of salt. Lightly grease a 10-inch nonstick skillet with vegetable oil and heat over medium heat until warmed but not sizzling hot. Add half the egg, swirling to cover entire bottom of pan and cook until egg has just set on top. </li>
            <li>Slice egg lengthwise into thin strips. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Rinse cucumber under cold running water, then pat dry with towels, squeezing gently to remove excess moisture.</li>
